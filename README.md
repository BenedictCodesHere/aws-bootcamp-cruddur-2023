# Cruddurclone

This application is designed to be a microblogging service in which users can create posts, reply to others, direct message other users, search the application, view the trending posts about certain topics.

The posts can be created as temporary posts, set to expire, the time range selected by the user from a dropdown list.

Part of the reason for creating this application was to demonstrate my capacity to build a production-grade fullstack application that is hosted on and integrated with AWS services.

The skills that are demonstrated in the development of this project include:
- Application Architecture design (LucidChart)
- Cloud networking configuration and routing (Virtual Private Cloud, Security Groups, Route 53)
- Scaling and load balancing (Application Load Balancer, Elastic Container Service, Target Groups)
- Responsive frontend web development (React, CSS)
- Efficient and secure backend development (Python, Flask, Elastic Container Service, Postgres, Relational Database Service, DynamoDB)
- Managing containerized applications (Docker, Elastic Container Registry, Elastic Container Service)
- Deploying architecture using YAML templates (CloudFormation)
- Continuous Integration pipelines (CodeDeploy, Codebuild, CodePipeline)
- Shell scripting for numerous dev tasks (e.g. seeding database data)
- Security (Security Groups, Secrets Manager, Systems Manager Parameter Store, Identity and Access Management)
- Storage (S3)
- Static Website Hosting (S3)
- Cache management and invalidation (CloudFront)
- Serverless where it makes sense (Lambda)
- Observability and Monitoring (XRay, CloudWatch Logs, CloudTrail)
- Cloning and modifying an open-source RubyGem's codebase for use with AWS STS, to aid with continuous development
